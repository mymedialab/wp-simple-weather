Yahoo-Weather
Yahoo uses weather.com as it's weather provider, so using the same steps as the above should work. However. If you would like to find your weather code through weather.yahoo.com, follow these steps.

1. Go to http://weather.yahoo.com
2. Search for your town and country (ie. London, United Kingdom or New york, NY, United States) - You will now see page with weather information. There are two ways to go from here.
3a. Click on the RSS-button which is to the right under the big bar.
4a. Look at the URL, it should be something like:
http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=UKXX0085&u=f
or
http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=USNY0996&u=f - The weather code is then UKXX0085 ( / USNY0996 )

3b. Click 'Extended forecast' in one of the columns that hold weather for each day.
4b. The URL should now look something like this:
http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/extended/UKXX0085

5. Take the weather code and paste in in your skin at the appropriate place. Save. Refresh.

Note:
Yahoo is in the process of an upgrade. It is removing the p= part and replacing it with w= to use the more powerful new WOEID codes.
So if you find that your weather stops working, try to change that. Some skins use p= and some use w=, so far p= is still the main and supports more locations but it will soon change.

To get the weather-code if you use w=, do this:
1-2. Same as above.
3. Look at the URL. Should be something like:
http://weather.yahoo.com/england/greater-london/london-44418
or
http://weather.yahoo.com/united-states/new-york/new-york-2459115
4. The weather-code is then 44418 ( / 2459115 )
